# BD-Attention for Image Captioning

great thanks to Luo's code [self-critical.pytorch](https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch) for providing a strong baseline for my experiments.

## Requirements
Python 2.7 (because there is no [coco-caption](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) version for python 3)
PyTorch 1.0 (along with torchvision)
cider (already been added as a submodule)

(**Skip if you are using bottom-up feature**): If you want to use resnet to extract image features, you need to download pretrained resnet model for both training and evaluation. The models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtbVYzOURMdDNHSGM), and should be placed in `data/imagenet_weights`.

## Train your own network on COCO/Flickr30k

### Prepare data.

We now support both flickr30k and COCO. See details in `data/README.md`. (Note: the later sections assume COCO dataset; it should be trivial to use flickr30k.)

### Start training

```bash
$ python train.py --id td_bda --caption_model topdown_preh_gate --input_json data/cocotalk.json --input_fc_dir data/cocotalk_fc --input_att_dir data/cocotalk_att --input_label_h5 data/cocotalk_label.h5 --batch_size 10 --learning_rate 5e-4 --learning_rate_decay_start 0 --scheduled_sampling_start 0 --checkpoint_path log_td_bda --save_checkpoint_every 6000 --val_images_use 5000 --max_epochs 30
```

The train script will dump checkpoints into the folder specified by `--checkpoint_path` (default = `save/`). We only save the best-performing checkpoint on validation and the latest checkpoint to save disk space.

To resume training, you can specify `--start_from` option to be the path saving `infos.pkl` and `model.pth` (usually you could just set `--start_from` and `--checkpoint_path` to be the same).

If you have tensorflow, the loss histories are automatically dumped into `--checkpoint_path`, and can be visualized using tensorboard.

The current command use scheduled sampling, you can also set scheduled_sampling_start to -1 to turn off scheduled sampling.

If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use `--language_eval 1` option, but don't forget to download the [coco-caption code](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) into `coco-caption` directory.

For more options, see `opts.py`. 

### Train using self critical

First you should preprocess the dataset and get the cache for calculating cider score:
```
$ python scripts/prepro_ngrams.py --input_json .../dataset_coco.json --dict_json data/cocotalk.json --output_pkl data/coco-train --split train
```

Then, copy the model from the pretrained model using cross entropy. (It's not mandatory to copy the model, just for back-up)
```
$ bash scripts/copy_model.sh fc fc_rl
```

Then
```bash
$ python train.py --id td_bda --caption_model topdown_preh_gate --input_json data/cocotalk.json --input_fc_dir data/cocotalk_fc --input_att_dir data/cocotalk_att --input_label_h5 data/cocotalk_label.h5 --batch_size 10 --learning_rate 5e-5 --start_from log_fc_rl --checkpoint_path log_td_bda_rl --save_checkpoint_every 6000 --language_eval 1 --val_images_use 5000 --self_critical_after 30 --cached_tokens coco-train-idxs
```

### Caption images after training

## Generate image captions

### Evaluate on raw images
Now place all your images of interest into a folder, e.g. `blah`, and run
the eval script:

```bash
$ python eval.py --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --image_folder blah --num_images 10
```

This tells the `eval` script to run up to 10 images from the given folder. If you have a big GPU you can speed up the evaluation by increasing `batch_size`. Use `--num_images -1` to process all images. The eval script will create an `vis.json` file inside the `vis` folder, which can then be visualized with the provided HTML interface:

```bash
$ cd vis
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now visit `localhost:8000` in your browser and you should see your predicted captions.

### Evaluate on Karpathy's test split

```bash
$ python eval.py --dump_images 0 --num_images 5000 --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --language_eval 1 
```

The defualt split to evaluate is test. The default inference method is greedy decoding (`--sample_method greedy`), to sample from the posterior, set `--sample_method sample`.

**Beam Search**. Beam search can increase the performance of the search for greedy decoding sequence by ~5%. However, this is a little more expensive. To turn on the beam search, use `--beam_size N`, N should be greater than 1.

## Miscellanea
**Using cpu**. The code is currently defaultly using gpu; there is even no option for switching. If someone highly needs a cpu model, please open an issue; I can potentially create a cpu checkpoint and modify the eval.py to run the model on cpu. However, there's no point using cpu to train the model.

**Train on other dataset**. It should be trivial to port if you can create a file like `dataset_coco.json` for your own dataset.

**Live demo**. Not supported now. Welcome pull request.
